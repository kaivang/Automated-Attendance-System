It is necessary to maintain discipline in an organization and to impart quality education in schools, colleges and where it is practicable to take corrective action if anyone drifts from the appropriate standards

#Automated attendance system aims to automate the time consuming data-entry process by using image processing and text extraction techniques

#In this project, we first convert a PDF scan copy of the customized attendance sheet into the image, identify and extract every row into a separate image and in end extract the relevant data into excels sheets.

#This system employs the traditional method of recording attendance on paper sheets and is devoid of any proxies as it taken by faculty itself. 

#The system mainly consist of following blocks
